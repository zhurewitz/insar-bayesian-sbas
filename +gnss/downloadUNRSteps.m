% FULL TEXT
%
% Information on database of potential steps in GPS time series
% 
% The steps master file can be found at http://geodesy.unr.edu/NGLStationPages/steps.txt
% Steps pertaining to individual stations are additionally found in a table at the bottom of each station page.
% 
% In steps.txt:
% Column 1 is the station 4-character ID
% 
% Column 2 is the step date in YYMMMDD format
% 
% Column 3 is the step type code where:
%   Code=1 is time of an equipment change from IGS log file (antenna, receiver or firmware change)
%   Code=2 is possible earthquake step where epicenter is within 10^(0.5*mag - 0.8) km of the station
% 
% if Code==1
%   Column 4 is the type of equipment change event
% if Code==2
%   Column 4 is the threshold distance for this event in km.
%   Column 5 is the distance from station to epicenter in km.
%   Column 6 is the event magnitude
%   Column 7 is the USGS event ID. Event information available at http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/<eventID>
% 
% Potential earthquake related steps are marked if the distance from station to epicenter is less than the threshold distance calculated using a simple formula based on event magnitude: r0 = 10.^(0.5*mag - 0.79) km.
% So a 4 gives 16 km
% a 5 gives 51 km
% a 6 gives 162 km
% a 7 gives 512 km
% an 8 gives 1622 km
% a 9 gives 5129 km
% 
% Event depth, style or directionality of displacement is currently not accounted for in the distance threshold. Actual displacement may not have occurred at the marked time.
